## Galax

In this game your bound to operate an alien ship. 
All alien operators are scattered in space after an accident. 
Your the human that needs to save them.
Usually alien operators have 8 arms. So it might be hard to operate the ship. 
But we are sure you will do your best.
At least the aliens left you human friendly controls. 

Unfortunatly they think we have only two arms - so we can only control the two buttons at the same time.


## How to play the game

The Blue button switches between flight mode and ship mode ( you see the current state at the top)

### Ship Mode

In the windows you see the aliens you have on the ship. 
The outer doors will open for a short time. 
Press any button ( left or right ) to keep an door open. 
When a door is open - the aliens will be selected automaticly. 

Press left or right to send an alien to the open door. The button you use matters, 
since this button controls your alien afterwards.

### Flight Mode 

In flight mode you can operate the aliens with the left and right button. 
Now have a safe flight.
